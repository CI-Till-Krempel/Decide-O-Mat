# US-017: Custom Domain

## Description
As a site owner, I want the application to be accessible via a professional custom domain (e.g., `decide-o-mat.com`) to build trust and brand identity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Domain**: Application is accessible via the custom domain.
2.  **SSL**: HTTPS is enabled and enforced.
3.  **Redirects**: `www` redirects to root (or vice versa) correctly.
