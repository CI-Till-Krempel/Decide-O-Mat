# Announcing Decide-O-Mat v1.5: Your Identity, Your Decisions

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Decide-O-Mat v1.5.0**! This release focuses on giving you control over your identity and making it easier to track your decisions across devices.

## What's New?

### 🔐 User Authentication & Profiles
You can now **sign in** using Google or Email/Password!
- **Persistent Profile**: Your name and decisions are saved to your account.
- **Cross-Device Access**: Log in on any device to see your decisions.
- **Self-Service**: Update your display name or delete your account at any time.

### 📋 My Decisions List
Lost a link? No problem! The new **"My Decisions"** page lists all the decisions you have created or participated in.
- See which decisions you own vs. were invited to.
- Quickly access open and closed decisions.
- Everything is end-to-end encrypted, just for you.

### 🕵️ Anonymous Identity Upgrades
Prefer not to log in? We improved the anonymous experience too:
- **One Vote Limit**: We now enforce one vote per person to keep decisions fair.
- **Magic Link Transfer**: Moving to a new phone? Generate a Magic Link to transfer your anonymous identity and history securely.

## What's Next?
We are working on **v1.6**, which will bring a visible **Participant List** and **Notifications** so you never miss a vote!

Happy Deciding!
The Decide-O-Mat Team
