# Decide-O-Mat v1.4.0: Secure & Responsive

We are excited to announce version 1.4.0 of Decide-O-Mat! This release brings two major improvements:
1.  **End-to-End Encryption**: Your decisions are now encrypted on your device before they are sent to the server. Only people with the link (which contains the key) can read them.
2.  **Loading Spinners**: Improved visual feedback with a loading spinner during data fetching and voting actions, making the app feel more responsive.

We hope you enjoy these updates!
