# Announcing Decide-O-Mat v1.3: It's Personal!

Decide-O-Mat is the easiest way to make collaborative decisions with friends and colleagues using simple pro/con lists. No more endless chat threads—just create a topic, share the link, and let the best arguments win.

## What's New in v1.3
We've made decision-making more transparent and personal:
*   **Who's Voting?**: You can now see exactly who voted for each argument and the final decision.
*   **Your Identity**: Enter your name once, and we'll remember it for all future decisions.
*   **Edit Anytime**: Made a typo? You can easily update your display name.

## Coming Up in v1.4
We're taking it to the next level with full user accounts! Expect:
*   **Secure Login**: Sign in with Google or email to keep your data safe.
*   **My Decisions**: A personal dashboard to track all your open and closed decisions.
*   **Stay Updated**: Notifications so you never miss a new argument or vote.

Stay tuned!
