# Release v1.3.3

This patch release focuses on **stabilizing the deployment pipeline** and fixing metadata display issues in the staging and production environments.

## Highlights
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Fixed permission issues blocking App Hosting rollouts.
- **Environment Metadata**: The application footer now correctly identifies "Staging" and "Production" environments instead of showing "Local".
- **Reproducibility**: Added `setup/` scripts to automate IAM and Secret configuration for new environments.
