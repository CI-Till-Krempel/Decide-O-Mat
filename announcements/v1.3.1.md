# Release v1.3.1

We are excited to announce **Decide-O-Mat v1.3.1**, a patch release focused on improving our deployment infrastructure and security.

This release includes:

### Deployment Pipeline Improvements
- **Service Account Security**: We've switched to using dedicated Service Accounts for Firebase deployments, enhancing security by adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- **Environment Awareness**: The application now correctly identifies its running environment (Staging vs. Production).

### User Interface Enhancements
- **Footer Info**: A new footer has been added to the application. In non-production environments, it displays helpful debugging information like the current environment name and commit hash.

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with detailed deployment and setup instructions.
- Added `RELEASE.md` to document our release process.
