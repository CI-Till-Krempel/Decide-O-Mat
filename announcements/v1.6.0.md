# Announcing Decide-O-Mat v1.6: A Complete Design Overhaul

We are excited to announce **Decide-O-Mat v1.6.0** — a major visual redesign that transforms every page of the application with a sleek dark theme, improved navigation, and powerful new management tools.

## What's New?

### Dark Theme & Design System (US-028)
The entire application has been rebuilt on a new design system based on our Figma designs:
- **Dark-only theme** with carefully chosen colors for readability and focus.
- **New typography**: "Alfa Slab One" for headings and "Open Sans" for body text.
- **CSS Modules architecture** replacing inline styles for maintainability.

### Redesigned Navigation & Footer (US-029, US-030)
- Responsive dark-themed navigation bar with integrated settings panel and language switcher.
- New footer with legal links (Terms, Privacy, Imprint) and version branding.

### Redesigned Pages (US-031, US-032, US-033, US-034)
Every page has been redesigned to match the new design system:
- **Home Page**: Full-bleed dark layout with clear call-to-action.
- **Voting Page**: New Election Hero component, floating argument input, and statement cards.
- **Results Page**: Dedicated results mode with ballot icon and color-coded outcome display.
- **My Decisions Page**: Decision cards with running/archived variants, context menu with keyboard navigation, and localized relative timestamps.

### Decision Management Actions (US-035)
Decision owners now have full control:
- **Edit Question**: Update the decision question (with end-to-end encryption support).
- **Delete Decision**: Permanently remove a decision and all associated data.
- **Close/Reopen**: Toggle decision status from both the decision page and My Decisions.

### Participant List & Notifications
- Real-time participant list showing who is part of each decision.
- Notification toggle for staying updated on decision activity.

## What's Next?
We are working on **v1.7**, which will bring **Private Decisions** with invite-only participation and enhanced notification capabilities.

Happy Deciding!
The Decide-O-Mat Team
